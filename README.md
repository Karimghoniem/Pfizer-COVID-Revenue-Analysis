# 📊 Analyzing the Financial Impact of COVID-19 on Pfizer (2018–2024)

## 🧾 Project Description:
This project explores the dramatic shift in Pfizer’s revenue structure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using public financial data from trusted sources, we analyzed how the launch of Comirnaty (Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine) and Paxlovid (antiviral treatment) affected the company’s overall revenue between 2018 and 2024.

The goal is to understand the financial boom caused by pandemic-related products and the company’s gradual return to its traditional revenue streams post-COVID.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- CSV (data storage and manipulation)
- Power BI / Excel (optional dashboard layer)
- Public Sources (MacroTrends, Pfizer Annual Reports)

## 📁 Dataset Includes:
- Annual total revenue from 2018 to 2024  
- COVID-related product revenue  
- Non-COVID product revenue  
- COVID-related revenue as a % of total revenue

## 📊 Key Insights:
- **2020**: COVID revenue was minimal (~$1.7B)
- **2021**: Revenue jumped to $36.8B due to vaccine launch
- **2022**: COVID-related products made up **56%** of Pfizer’s total revenue
- **2023–2024**: Sharp decline in COVID sales to $12.5B and then lower, making up ~16% of total revenue in 2024

## 📌 Conclusion:
COVID-19 caused a massive, but temporary, transformation in Pfizer’s business model. The company experienced unprecedented financial growth through pandemic products but began transitioning back to its core therapeutic areas (oncology, chronic disease, vaccines) by 2023.
